# UniMIN
Testing against umbrella-ordered alternatives in one-way ANOVA Code is for testing equality means against umbrella-ordered alternatives in one-way ANOVA. We have considered testing of H_0:mu_1 = mu_2 = ... = mu_k vs. H_1:mu_1 <= mu_2<=....<= mu_h >=....>= mu_k (at least one strict inequality), where mu_i represent the population means of different treatments. The input has two variables: a sample_data list and a significance_level. The output includes the critical value, the UniMIN test statistic value, and the result, indicating whether the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the value of the test statistic exceeds the critical value, we will reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we will not reject it.
